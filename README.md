# Silent 500 Errors in Next.js API Routes

This example demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where errors from API routes are not handled gracefully, resulting in a poor user experience. The `About` page fetches data from an API route that intentionally throws a 500 error.  The default Next.js behavior is to silently fail without any user-visible indication of the error.

## Problem

The `about.js` file fetches data asynchronously. However, it doesn't include error handling for when the API route (`/api/data`) returns a 500 error.  This leads to a broken application with no feedback to the user.
